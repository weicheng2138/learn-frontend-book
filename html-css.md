# HTML/CSS

## HTML

It's all about Semantic, which leads to better SEO purpose.

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

* `em` &gt; `i` ****\(_example_\)/ ****`strong` ****&gt; ****`b` \(**example**\) 
* `<img alt="" />`should put the content in alt for better to be search. Of course, the content should be highly related to the description of the image.
* `tbody` has the benefit to show the content when your view can see the content. Previous work may show all the contents at the beginning.

Log-in validation or financial related validation is better to construct in backend than frontend. In case of some hackers may take a detour instead of your frontend validation.
